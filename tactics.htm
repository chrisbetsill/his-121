					<p class="lead">This illustration is taken fragments of the 'Cocharelli Codex' manuscript and was created in Genoa in the 1330s by an unknown artist. It depicts the fall of Tripoli in 1289 to Mamluk Turks and offers a beautiful rendition of the types troops and tactics typical of Muslim and European Crusader armies during the crusades. Most notably, it highlights the European use of heavy cavalry and the famous Turkish mounted archers.</p>

                    <h2>How were battles fought?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">There is actually a fair amount of primary source material regarding the tactics of medieval armies.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, some may be surprised at first when examining the degree to which warfare has facilitated the transfer of ideas across embittered fronts (Nicolle 579). However, there are very practical reasons for enemies to adopt the ideas of their opponents, chiefly it was a matter of survival. In the face of what appeared to be a superior opponent, oftentimes the losing side would adopt the military technology – ranging from weapons and armor to tactics and military organizations – of their enemy.</p>
					
					<p>In fact, there were even military manuals, often written by the Byzantines, that go into great detail. Perhaps one of the best examples of this type of document was the Taktika, which was written by (or at least in the name of) Emperor Leo VI in the 9th century, and draws from similar documents written by earlier emperors. Although this was well before the Third Crusade, the Taktika details the prototypical tactics which they observed over centuries of conflicts with Muslim armies. From this, we can glimpse how Muslim armies operated. For example, we know that Muslim forces usually used camels to transport supplies, since camels were said to frighten the horses of attacking cavalry (Nicolle 588).  Along this line, they also utilized cymbals and drums to further try to scare off enemy horses. In regard to troops, the Taktika notes that the bulk of Muslim infantry forces were comprised of African archers. They also used cavalry forces, equipped with swords, spears and axes, as well as mounted archers. Interestingly, the Taktika notes that Muslim cavalry were armored in a similar style to the Byzantine forces, with helmets, cuirasses, lined half-boots, and gauntlets (Nicolle 589), and have a tendency to embellish some of their equipment with silver ornamentation.</p>
					
					<p>Muslim armies were typically arranged with infantry forces as the vanguard, with the cavalry behind them as they prepare to attack. The Taktika notes that Muslim troops would organize into a large square (also similar to Byzantine troops), and try to maintain this formation in battle. When they were in formation they typically were patient in battle, and were not quick to charge, waiting for the enemy to tire before they pushed forward. This is because this type of formation was very difficult to break, and the Byzantine’s noted that Muslim forces “received the first shock (charge) like iron”.</p>
					
					<p>Yet the Taktika notes that if the square formation breaks, Muslim forces quickly fall to disorder and are difficult to rally (Nicolle 589). It attributes this to the Islamic forces belief that the outcome of the battle, and indeed everything, is in the hands of God (Nicolle 589). The Byzantines believed that this made Muslim soldiers complacent when the tide of battle turns against them.</p>
