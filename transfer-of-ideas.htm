					<p class="lead">The painting is titled Sabobai and Benaiah, it is a Christian painting by Konrad Witz dated to
1435. Today the painting can be seen in the Kunstmuseum Basel in Basel, Switzerland, where it
originates from. The image of the painting was accessed online at Wikiart. The painting is an
excellent depiction of a knight in full armor, notable is the standard hilt sword and bascinet
helmet.</p>

                    <h2>How were ideas transferred across fronts?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, and even in war this old maxim holds true.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, some may be surprised at first when examining the degree to which warfare has facilitated the transfer of ideas across embittered fronts (Nicolle 579). However, there are very practical reasons for enemies to adopt the ideas of their opponents, chiefly it was a matter of survival. In the face of what appeared to be a superior opponent, oftentimes the losing side would adopt the military technology – ranging from weapons and armor to tactics and military organizations – of their enemy.</p>
					
					<p>Regarding the conflicts between Christians and Muslims during the crusades, there are fairly evident examples of Muslim technologies employed by Christians. To start, there was the bascinet helmet, which appeared in Italy in the late thirteenth century, and features heavily stylistic influences likely taken from earlier crusading conflicts with the Muslim world (Nicolle 583). In addition, the coat-of-plates appeared in Spain and other parts of Europe around the same time, which largely can be attributed to acceptance and appreciation of the semi-flexible armor employed by their Muslim opponents. In terms of weaponry, we can see that small changes in construction, overall shape, and size of the European composite bow mirrored developments made by their more dominant Turkish foes (Nicolle 583-4).</p>

					<p>Although the Franks were often the ones who were adopting new technologies, that does not mean this was the only direction in which new ideas flowed. In fact, in the Iberian Peninsula, Muslim forces adopted multiple quintessentially European tactics and weapons. To a large degree, this centered around the use of heavy cavalry, and included the adoption of heavy armor, the couched lance, the deep saddle, and the shock tactics associated with these types of troops and weaponry (Nicolle 585). As is sometimes the case when employing foreign technologies and tactics, Muslim forces had limited success when imitating European heavy cavalry.</p>
					
					<p>The transfer of ideas and technologies across fronts is perhaps most evident – and most fluid – in maritime technology. Areas like shipbuilding, types of rigging, and oar placement were the areas where new ideas spread the fastest and had the least amount of pushback (Nicolle 587). Perhaps this is because there was so much riding on sailing during that era – it was one of the fastest ways to move troops and supplies, and sailors and merchants had to rely on these technologies for both their livelihoods and their lives. A prime example of the transfer of maritime technology is the tarida, of Islamic origin, which is a specialized horse-transporting galley that was enthusiastically adopted by their European opponents (Nicolle 587).</p>
					
					<p>Perhaps what is even more interesting are the instances where the losing side did not copy their more successful foes. In some cases, this was simply because they were unable to adequately transfer the superior tactics or technology. A prime example of this can be seen in the crusaders inability to effectively duplicate the horse-mounted archery tactics of the Turks. This inability springs from a lack of sufficient grazing areas to support the number of horses required, and the fact that there simply was not the same nomadic military tradition in Europe that made the Turks so effective (Nicolle 581). Yet there were also less pragmatic reasons for refusing to copy a superior force, often centered around religious identity and cultural pride. Indeed, even something as mundane as sword shape was often connected to religious imagery, as is evident in Christian Spain, where sword hilts were consciously modeled after the cross.</p>
