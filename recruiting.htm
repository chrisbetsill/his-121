					<p class="lead">The image is titled ‘Saladin Rex Aegypti’, or Saladin King of Egypt in English, it is from a 15 th
century manuscript. The exact museum that has the manuscript with this painting was not able to
be found online. It was accessed online at Wikipedia. It depicts Saladin holding a piece of bread
in one hand, symbolizing peace and prosperity. In the other hand he is holding a sword
symbolizing his conquest. The significance of Saladin holding both a sword and bread shows the
balance between the two that was seen in Saladin’s life.</p>

                    <h2>How were armies raised? How were they maintained?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">What is evident in both Christian and Muslim contexts is an understanding that their military hardships were products of their unfaithfulness...</p>
                    <p>Leaders from both cultures used, and in some ways modified, existing religious institutions to mobilize and unify their respective forces, and although some modern scholars are quick to regard this supposed piety as propaganda, it is important to remember that although their religious beliefs were able to be exploited, they were undoubtedly sincere.

					<p>One common need for any commander trying to fight a war in the middle-ages was that of an army. This was especially true during the Crusades, where a new type of war saw the creation of new ways to raise armies. In the case of European Christians, this is most evident with the various papal bulls which initiated the recruiting process. This is true of the Third Crusade, which was initiated by Pope Gregory VIII’s Audita tremendi in October of 1187, and was a direct response to the Frankish defeat at the Battle of Hattin that same year (Jotischky, 156) . In it, Pope Gregory emphasizes that it was the sins of the Latin States which brought about their ruin, and that by refusing to give aid to the Outremer, they had left God no choice but to allow Saladin victory. He goes on to say that through true penitence (which conveniently took the form of taking on the crusader vows) they could restore the Holy Sepulcher and be forgiven.</p>

					<p>Muslim leaders also had a religious foundation for recruitment, in the form of jihad. As one might expect, there are some similarities between jihad and the Christian concept of crusading. For example, Syrian jurist al-Sulami (d. 1106) connected the horrors inflicted by the Franks during the First Crusade to Allah punishing the Muslims because of their neglect of religious duties, especially jihad. This is strikingly similar to Pope Gregory’s assessment that Christian defeats were punishment for their sins. 

					<p>Yet, during Saladin's time, not many volunteered for jihad despite his continued propaganda campaign through use of religious scholars, poets and historians who he employed to portray him as an austere ruler motivated by religious conviction (Bonner 111). Since he could not rely on volunteers to be the basis of his armies, Saladin gathered his troops from a variety of different means, including from different iqtas (fiefdoms that had a similar function to their feudal European counterparts) which he had given to his relatives (Jotischky, 115). He also relied on the continued use of Turkish slaves as the bulk of his cavalry (Bonner 111), and often employed “soldiers of fortune” to supplement his forces.</p>

					<p>Europe, on the other hand, had no such shortage of volunteers, but interestingly, it was not the Third Crusades leaders who first answered the Pope’s call. Instead, before Philip and Henry were able to mobilize, a Sicilian fleet was able to destroy a large portion of Saladin's Egyptian navy, and more than 15,000 troops from all over Europe had already landed in the Holy Land and had begun to retake Acre (Jotischky, 157). Clearly, the Pope’s call to join the crusade in return for plenary indulgences (the full remission of sin) had been effective, as thousands from all over Europe answered his call.</p>

					<p>Yet even with troops, war is an expensive undertaking. Fortunately for the crusaders both Henry and Philip had imposed the “Saladin tithe”, which was a tax of one-tenth on all movables for both the clergy and the laity. Thus they were able to insure that their armies would be well supplied for the duration of the crusade. Yet, it seems as if Saladin’s financial planning was not as secure as that of his European opponent - he was always running low on money (Jotischky, 118). Saladin’s own first minister, al-Fadil, pointed out that Saladin spent the spoils of Egypt on conquering Syria, and used all of the wealth he gained in Syria to control Mesopotamia, and then spent the entirety of his Mesopotamian spoils on his campaign in Palestine (Jotischky, 118). It is a matter of debate if his financial troubles were due to entirely to his poor planning, or, as some of his contemporaries attributed it to, was in part caused by his  renowned generosity. Nevertheless when Saladin died, his treasury contained only 47 dirhems and a single gold piece.</p>

					<p>Besides raising armies, military leaders also needed to quell internal conflicts and divisions. Where Saladin's propaganda efforts were somewhat inneffective in gaining volunteers, they did contribute to a Sunni revival among Muslims. This revival combined the ideology of jihad with a stern view of “dissident” Muslims (Bonner 111), which aided Saladin in consolidating his power and unifying his forces. In Europe, parts of Pope Gregory’s Audita tremendi served a similar function. The pope condemned inter-faith violence between Christians, and made calls for peace by appealing to the loss of the True Cross at Hattin (Jotischky, 156). This gave Christians a sufficient rallying point at which they were able to set aside their differences to defeat a common enemy. Most notably, France’s Philip II and England’s Henry II were able to sign a truce that ended a bitter stalemated war that neither appeared capable of ending (Jotischky, 156). What is more, upon hearing that his former foe Henry (and his son Richard) had taken up the cross for the crusade, Philip was honor bound to do the same, and when German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa joined in pursuit of military glory, the Third Crusade would have the support of three distinct European powers.</p>
